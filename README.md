Schedule
========

![IDE Screenshot](/Schedule/Schedule.png "Schedule")

Schedule is a programming language for events.

The language is based on an EBNF grammar and generated by JTB tool. The project also contains a prototipal IDE, some interpeters and compilers for Schedule language. It can play generate iCalendar files, send mails to participants and create WebViews (HTML+CSS).

Plese read the JavaDoc for further doubts.

In this project I used:
- JavaCC https://javacc.java.net
- iCal4J http://build.mnode.org/projects/ical4j/
- javaMail http://javamail.java.net
